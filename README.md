# Extended Writer

Extended Writer supercharges Kirby's built-in Writer field and block with useful marks, nodes and features you wish were built-in.

## Features

- New marks:
  - **Highlight**: Highlight text using the html `<mark>` tag
- New nodes:
  - **Larger Paragraph**: A larger paragraph, e.g. for short introduction or highlighted passages. (`<div class="-larger-paragraph">`)
- Enable & disable heading levels of the heading node with `h1`/`h2`/`h3`/`h4`/`h5`/`h6`
- Node property support for the List field, to disable the default bullet list or ordered list nodes
- Styling customizations via props (e.g. text-align)

## Requirements

- `Kirby` >= 3.6.0
- `php` >= 7.4 / 8.0
